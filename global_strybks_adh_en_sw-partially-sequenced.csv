Nyathi Ma Nyakare,Donkey Child,Mtoto Punda
Aneno dhano to akaŋasa go tek tek,It was a little girl who first saw the mysterious shape in the distance,Ilikuwa ni msichana mdogo aliyekuwa wa kwanza kuona umbo la ajabu kwa mbali
To aneno dhako ma yac ma omako iye,"As the shape moved closer, she saw that it was a heavily pregnant woman","Kadiri umbo lilipokaribia, aliona kwamba lilikuwa ni mwanamke mwenye ujauzito mkubwa"
"
	Jo calo mawan jo jolo dhako no to doŋ both wan.
	","
	Shy but brave, the little girl moved nearer to the woman.

“We must keep her with us,” the little girl’s people decided. “We’ll keep her and her child safe.”
	","
	Kwa upole na ujasiri, msichana alimsogelea mwanamke yule. “Lazima tumhifadhi,” watu wa msichana yule walisema. “Tutawaweka yeye na mtoto wake salama.”
	"
"I dyer wor dhako no okoko ni, “Nyathi! Eno nyathi wok",The child was soon on its way,Mtoto alikuwa njiani kuzaliwa si muda mrefu
”,"

“Push!”

“Bring blankets!”

“Water!”

“Puuuuussssshhh!!!”", “Sukuma!” “Leteni mablanketi!” “Maji!” “Suuukuuumaaaa!!!”
"
	Dhako no to nywolo punda.
	","
	But when they saw the baby, everyone jumped back in shock.

“A donkey?!”
	","
	Lakini walipomwona mtoto, wote waliruka kwa mshtuko. “Punda?!”
	"
"
	Ji jo penjere ni, “Wa no tim nedi?”
	","
	Everyone began to argue.

“We said we would keep mother and child safe, and that’s what we’ll do,” said some.

“But they will bring us bad luck!” said others.
	","
	Wakaanza kubishana. “Tulisema tutawaweka mama na mtoto salama, na hivyo ndivyo tutakavyofanya,” baadhi wakasema. “Lakini watatuletea mkosi!” wengine wakadai.
	"
"
	Ji jo ŋweco kwoŋ go. To dhako no paro ni, “A la timere nedi gi nyathi me?”
	","
	And so the woman found herself alone again.

She wondered what to do with this awkward child.

She wondered what to do with herself.
	","
	Kwa hiyo mwanamke yule alijikuta yuko peke yake kwa mara nyingine tena. Akajiuliza atafanya nini na mtoto huyo wa ajabu. Akajiuliza atafanya nini na yeye mwenyewe.
	"
"Rumacen, dhako no oyere to maro nyathi pere",But finally she had to accept that he was her child and she was his mother,Lakini hatimaye alikubali kwamba huyo ni mwanaye na yeye ni mama yake
"
	Nyathi no odongo, obedo ma dwoŋ, ma odhyero kir min tiŋo.
	","
	Now, if the child had stayed that same, small size, everything might have been different. But the donkey child grew and grew until he could no longer fit on his mother’s back.

And no matter how hard he tried, he could not behave like a human being. His mother was often tired and frustrated. Sometimes she made him do work meant for animals.
	","
	Endapo mtoto huyo angebaki kuwa vilevile, na umbo dogo, labda kila kitu kingekuwa tofauti. Lakini mtoto Punda aliendelea kukua na kukua mpaka hakuweza kutoshea tena mgongoni mwa mama yake. Pamoja na kujaribu kwa bidii, hakuweza kuwa na tabia za kibinadamu. Mara nyingi mama yake alichoka na kuvunjika moyo. Wakati mwingine alimlazimisha kufanya kazi walizostahili wanyama.
	"
"
	Min obedo gi gut. Nyathi pere bende omako nge to gweyo go.
	","
	Confusion and anger built up inside Donkey. He couldn’t do this and he couldn’t do that. He couldn’t be like this and he couldn’t be like that.

He became so angry that, one day, he kicked his mother to the ground.
	","
	Kuchanganyikiwa na hasira vilianza kujengeka ndani mwa Punda. Alishindwa kufanya hivi wala vile. Alishindwa kuwa hivi wala vile. Alipatwa na hasira sana kiasi kwamba, siku moja, alimpiga teke mama yake mpaka akaanguka chini.
	"
"
	Oŋweco woko munyo oneno min opodho piny.
	","
	Donkey was filled with shame. He started to run away as far and fast as he could.
	","
	Punda alijawa na aibu. Akaanza kukimbilia mbali kwa haraka kadiri awezavyo.
	"
"
	Nyathi punda odoŋ kende, kec oneko, ool, to nindo kwalo.
	","
	By the time he stopped running, it was night, and Donkey was lost.

“Hee haw?” he whispered to the darkness.

“Hee Haw?” it echoed back. He was alone.

Curling himself into a tight ball, he fell into a deep and troubled sleep.
	","
	Wakati aliposimama, ilikuwa ni usiku, na alikuwa amepotea. “Hii hoo?” alinong’ona gizani. “Hii hoo?” giza likatoa mwangwi. Alikuwa mwenyewe. Alijikunyata katika umbo dogo, akalala fofofo usingizi wa mang’amung’amu.
	"
"
	Munyo nyathi punda ocew, oneno jal moro ocungo dho bothe.
	","
	Donkey woke up to find a strange old man staring down at him. He looked into the old man’s eyes and started to feel a twinkle of hope.
	","
	Punda aliamka na kumkuta mzee mmoja wa ajabu akimtazama. Akamwangalia mzee yule machoni na akaanza kuhisi ishara ya matumaini.
	"
"
	Jalo otiŋo go to dok gine peco pere.
	","
	Donkey went to stay with the old man, who taught him many different ways to survive.

Donkey listened and learned, and so did the old man. They helped each other, and they laughed together.
	","
	Punda alienda kuishi na mzee yule, na mzee alimfundisha mbinu nyingi za kuishi. Punda alisikiliza na kujifunza, na mzee vivyo hivyo pia. Walisaidiana na kucheka pamoja.
	"
Nyathi punda otiŋo jalo i gongo munyo otegino,"One morning, the old man asked Donkey to carry him to the top of a mountain","Asubuhi moja, mzee alimwomba Punda ambebe hadi kwenye kilele cha mlima"
"
	Ndir acel, jo idho wi got moro kir malo, jo ol to jo podho nindo.
	","
	High up amongst the clouds they fell asleep.

Donkey dreamed that his mother was sick and calling to him.

And when he woke up…
	","
	Walipofika juu kwenye mawingu, walipatwa na usingizi. Punda akaota kuwa mama yake alikuwa mgonjwa na alimhitaji. Na alipoamka…
	"
"Munyo nyathi punda ocew, onwaŋo ni nitye kende kendo","… the clouds had disappeared along with his friend, the old man","…mawingu yalikuwa yametoweka pamoja na rafiki yake, yule mzee"
"

	","
	Donkey finally knew what to do.
	","
	Hatimaye, Punda alijua alichotakiwa kufanya.
	"
"
	Nyathi punda oneno dhano moro to penjere ni, “Meno
	","
	Donkey found his mother, alone and mourning her lost child. They stared at each other for a long time.

And then hugged each other very hard.
	","
	Punda alimkuta mama yake akiwa peke yake huku akimwomboleza mwanaye aliyepotea. Wakaangaliana kwa muda mrefu. Na kisha wakakumbatiana kwa hisia.

	Kuku akabeuwa. Akameza mate na kutema. Halafu akapiga chafya na kukohoa. Akakohoa tena. Jongoo alimfanya ajisikie vibaya.

Gweno owolo nyuka owolo woko Ongongolo iyii go,Chicken coughed until she coughed out the millipede that was in her stomach,"Kuku alikohoa, hadi akamtema jongoo aliyekuwa tumboni mwake"
 Yoki Ongongolo gi nyathi pere jurweta malo iwi yathi pondo, Mother Millipede and her child crawled up a tree to hide, Mama Jongoo na mwanaye wakakwea mti kujificha
"Woki isawa no, Gwendi kodi Ongongolini jubedo jukwori","From that time, chickens and millipedes were enemies","Tangu hapo, Kuku na Jongoo ni maadui"
